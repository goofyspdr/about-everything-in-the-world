We like to think of Bazaar of thoughts, as a virtual coffee shop where friends meet and have various discussions about their life experiences. This is a place for self-expression, advice, unique perspectives on life, and interesting research projects.

The contributors come from different backgrounds, countries, cultures, and beliefs.

This is a place where we come together and express our thoughts. The subjects are quite varied ranging from wellness, animals, history, science, spirituality, business, technology, and more.

It is important to note that we are not doctors, engineers, or psychologists.
Any information that you gather here is expressed as a point of view. If you are not feeling physically or mentally well, then you must consult a professional in the field and get professional help.

Having said that, life experience is a valuable asset and the bazaar of thoughts is what it is. A bazaar of thoughts.
